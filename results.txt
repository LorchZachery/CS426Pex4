Calling function 1

Printing a string variable, should be 'In function1'
In function1
Printing a float, should be 2.8
2.8
Calling function 2 and then function 1



in function2

Testing math operations, should be 48

--------------------------------------
Testing general if's alongside equality operations

Testing equality operator, 3 == 3, should print a statement saying so
Made it into equality test 3 == 3


Testing > operator, 4 > 3, should print a statement saying so
Made it into 4 > 3 test


Testing >= operator, 3 >= 3 and 4 >= 3, should print a statement saying so
Made it into 4 >= 3 test
Made it into 3 >= 3 test


Testing < operator, 2 < 3, should print a statement saying so
Made it into 2 < 3 test


Testing <= operator, 3 <= 3 and 2 <= 3, should print a statement saying so
Made it into 3 <= 3 test
Made it into 2 <= 3 test


Testing != operator, 4 != 3, should print a statement saying so
Made it into 4 != 3 test
----------------------------------------------------
Testing If-Else statements

testing an if-else inside an if statement
1 == 1, inside first if
1 != 2, this is the else statement to if 1 == 2, I should be here


Testing General If-Else, should go to else
Correctly entered the else statement for 69 > 420


Testing if{if{..}} else, should go in both ifs
Made it in the first if.
Made it in the second if.
----------------------------------------------------
Testing while loops
Testing while loop for x = 0 to x < 3
x is 0
x is 1
x is 2
Exited while loop.

Testing if-else inside a while loop.
Entering while loop - x <= 2
x is 0
Entered else statement - x <= 1
x is 1
Entered else statement - x <= 1
x is 2
Entered if statement if x > 1
Exited while loop.

Testing while loops inside an if statement.
Entering if statement - if y (0) < x (5).
Entered if statement, entering while statement to increment y up to x.
y is currently 0
y is currently 1
y is currently 2
y is currently 3
y is currently 4
Exited while loop, checking y value - 5
Checking x value - 5
exited if statement.
----------------------------------------------------
